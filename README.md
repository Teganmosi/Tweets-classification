# Tweets-classification
This GitHub repository contains code for a Natural Language Processing (NLP) project. The goal of this project is to build a binary classification model to classify text data ( tweets )as either a real disaster or not a real disaster.

The repository includes the following steps and components:

1. Checking for GPU availability and downloading necessary helper functions.
2. Downloading the dataset and unzipping it.
3. Importing required libraries and examining the data.
4. Preprocessing the data, including splitting it into training and validation sets.
5. Implementing text vectorization to convert text data into numerical representation.
6. Creating a baseline model using a TF-IDF vectorizer and a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier.
7. Evaluating the baseline model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
8. Building a deep learning model using dense layers for text classification.
9. Training the model and evaluating its performance on the validation set.
10. Visualizing the learned word embeddings.
11. Implementing a recurrent neural network (RNN) model using LSTM cells for text classification.
12. Training the LSTM model and evaluating its performance.
13. Comparing the results of the LSTM model with the baseline model.
14. Building another RNN model using GRU cells for text classification.
15. Training the GRU model and evaluating its performance.

This repository provides a step-by-step implementation of various models for text classification tasks and serves as a learning resource for NLP enthusiasts.
